Demographic simulation supplement

Demographic simulations were performed using the program, ms (Hudson, 2001). Simulations assumed an ancestral population size of 10,659 and a total epoch of 40k. Theta is the mutation parameter and equal to 4N0u (see methods). The ms command lines for each population are shown below. 

East Asian (CHB)
Bottleneck for tdur generations, instantaneous recovery to NA afterwards.
tdur=600, b=0.1:   ms 206 1000 -t Theta  -eN 0.037527 1.0 -eN 0.02345 0.1 -eN 0.0 1.0 >CHB.out

European (CEU)
Bottleneck for tdur generations, instantaneous recovery to NA afterwards.
tdur =800, b=0.2: ms 198 1000 -t Theta  -eN 0.037527 1.0 -eN 0.01876 0.2 -eN 0.0 1.0 >CEU.out

African (YRI)
Exponential growth from initial size NA to N0, occurring tonset generations in the past.
NA =10659, N0= 11156, tonset = 1000: ms 216 1000 -t Theta  -eG 0.02241 0 >YRI.out
